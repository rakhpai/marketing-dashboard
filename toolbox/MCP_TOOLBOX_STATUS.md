# MCP Toolbox Status Report

## Current Status

The MCP Toolbox for Databases is now running with a minimal configuration. We encountered several issues with the database configurations that prevented the service from starting:

1. **BigQuery Configuration**: The current version of MCP Toolbox has strict parameter naming requirements that we're still investigating.
   - Issues with field names: `credentials_file`, `key_file`, `dataset_id`
   - Need to determine the exact required field names for the current toolbox version

2. **Supabase Configuration**: Similar issues with SSL parameter naming
   - Issues with field names: `ssl_mode`, `sslmode`, `tls`
   - Need to determine the correct SSL configuration format for PostgreSQL connections

3. **Local PostgreSQL**: Not currently installed on the server

## Next Steps

1. **Research Correct Configuration Format**:
   - Review the MCP Toolbox documentation or source code to identify the exact parameter names required
   - Test different configuration formats until we find a working solution

2. **PostgreSQL Setup**:
   - Consider installing PostgreSQL locally for development/testing
   - Or focus on the Supabase connection which already exists

3. **Supabase Connection**:
   - Test direct connectivity to Supabase from the server using psql to verify credentials
   - Experiment with different SSL configurations to find a working solution

4. **BigQuery Connection**:
   - Verify that the service account key file exists and has correct permissions
   - Test direct connectivity to BigQuery from the server to verify credentials
   - Experiment with different authentication configurations

## Current Configuration

The current configuration in `tools.yaml` is a minimal setup with no database sources or tools defined. This was done to allow the service to start while we investigate the correct configuration format.

```yaml
sources:
  # Database sources will be configured once we resolve connection issues
  # For now, we're leaving this empty to allow the service to start

tools:
  # Tools will be added once database sources are properly configured

toolsets:
  # Toolsets will be updated once tools are properly configured
```

Once we resolve the configuration issues, we will restore the database sources, tools, and toolsets based on the backed-up configurations.
