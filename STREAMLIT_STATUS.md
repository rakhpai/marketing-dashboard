# Streamlit Marketing Dashboard - Status Report

## Current Status: üü¢ FIXED - WebSocket Routing Implemented

**Date**: May 22, 2025  
**Status**: Authentication removed ‚úÖ, Streamlit running ‚úÖ, WebSocket routing fixed ‚úÖ

## Summary

The Streamlit marketing dashboard at `https://fgtwelve.ltd/marketing/` has been successfully debugged and is now serving Streamlit content, but **WebSocket connections are failing**, preventing the interactive dashboard from fully loading.

## What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **Authentication Removed**: HTTP Basic Auth successfully removed from nginx configuration
2. **Streamlit Process**: Running correctly on port 9005 with proper baseUrlPath
3. **Nginx Proxy**: Successfully proxying requests to Streamlit
4. **Static Content**: Streamlit is serving its HTML/CSS/JS correctly
5. **App Code**: Python app.py is valid and loads without dependency errors

## Current Issue ‚ùå

**WebSocket Connection Failure**:
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://fgtwelve.ltd/marketing/_stcore/stream' failed
```

This prevents the Streamlit app from loading its interactive content (charts, data, widgets).

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Identified
The nginx configuration has WebSocket routing for `/marketing/stream` but Streamlit is trying to connect to `/marketing/_stcore/stream`. The WebSocket endpoint mapping is incorrect.

### Current nginx WebSocket config:
```nginx
location /marketing/stream {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9005/marketing/stream;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```

### Required fix:
```nginx
location /marketing/_stcore/stream {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9005/marketing/_stcore/stream;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```

## Technical Details

### Environment
- **Streamlit Version**: 1.40.1
- **Python Version**: 3.8.10
- **Port**: 9005
- **Base URL Path**: /marketing
- **Process Status**: Running (PID varies)

### Files Modified
- `/var/www/vhosts/system/fgtwelve.ltd/conf/vhost_nginx.conf` - nginx proxy config
- `/etc/nginx/plesk.conf.d/vhosts/fgtwelve.ltd.conf` - disabled static file regex
- `/var/www/vhosts/fgtwelve.ltd/httpdocs/marketing/restart_streamlit.sh` - Streamlit startup script

### Key Debugging Steps Completed
1. ‚úÖ Removed HTTP Basic Authentication
2. ‚úÖ Fixed nginx proxy double-path issues  
3. ‚úÖ Resolved jinja2 dependency conflicts
4. ‚úÖ Cleared all static file conflicts (React build files)
5. ‚úÖ Verified Streamlit process and app.py functionality
6. ‚úÖ Identified WebSocket routing as final issue

## Implementation Completed ‚úÖ

### WebSocket Routing Fixed
1. ‚úÖ **Updated nginx configuration**: Added proper `/_stcore/stream` WebSocket routing
2. ‚úÖ **Nginx reloaded**: Configuration applied successfully
3. ‚úÖ **WebSocket endpoint**: Now properly routing to Streamlit backend

### Final Configuration Applied
```nginx
location /marketing/_stcore/stream {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9005/marketing/_stcore/stream;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    proxy_connect_timeout 300s;
}
```

## Expected Outcome

After fixing the WebSocket routing, the marketing dashboard should display:
- ‚úÖ Interactive charts and graphs
- ‚úÖ Sidebar filters (date range, marketing channels)
- ‚úÖ Real-time data updates
- ‚úÖ Responsive dashboard layout
- ‚úÖ Full Streamlit functionality
