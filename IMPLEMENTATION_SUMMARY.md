- ✅ Supports booking stats, revenue data, vehicle stats, quote analytics
- ✅ Customer statistics and route performance tracking
- ✅ Payment method analytics

#### 2.4 Main Application Update
- ✅ Updated `app.py` to use real BigQuery data with fallback to simulated data
- ✅ Implemented data caching with TTL for performance
- ✅ Added connection testing in sidebar
- ✅ Real-time data toggle option
- ✅ Auto-refresh capability (30-second intervals)

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing the Dashboard
- URL: https://fgtwelve.ltd/marketing/
- The dashboard is served on port 9005 internally

### Features Available:
1. **Date Range Selection**: Filter data by custom date ranges
2. **Data Source Toggle**: Switch between real BigQuery data and sample data
3. **Connection Testing**: Test BigQuery connectivity from the sidebar
4. **Auto-refresh**: Enable 30-second auto-refresh for real-time monitoring

### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status streamlit-marketing.service

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart streamlit-marketing.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u streamlit-marketing.service -n 50
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:

1. **Phase 3: Advanced Analytics**
   - Implement predictive analytics for traffic trends
   - Add anomaly detection for sudden changes
   - Create custom alerts for performance thresholds

2. **Phase 4: Production Optimization**
   - Implement Redis caching for improved performance
   - Add connection pooling for BigQuery
   - Create production-specific configurations

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Real-time Supabase integration for live updates
   - User authentication and role-based access
   - Export functionality for reports
   - Email scheduling for automated reports
   - Integration with Google Analytics 4
   - Custom dashboard templates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **BigQuery Connection Failed**:
   - Check service account key at `/var/www/vhosts/fgtwelve.ltd/env_files/seo_secrets/seo-integration-key.json`
   - Verify BigQuery permissions for the service account

2. **No Data Displayed**:
   - Check date range selection
   - Verify BigQuery tables have data for selected period
   - Use "Test Data Connection" button to diagnose

3. **Dashboard Not Loading**:
   - Check service status: `sudo systemctl status streamlit-marketing.service`
   - Review logs: `sudo journalctl -u streamlit-marketing.service -n 100`

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
1. Monitor BigQuery usage and costs
2. Update dependencies monthly: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
3. Review and optimize slow queries
4. Clean up old cache data
5. Monitor dashboard performance metrics

## Security Considerations

1. Service account credentials are stored securely
2. API endpoints should implement authentication
3. Consider implementing user authentication for the dashboard
4. Regular security updates for dependencies

## Performance Notes

- Data is cached for 5-10 minutes to reduce BigQuery costs
- Heavy queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Dashboard supports concurrent users
- Auto-refresh should be used judiciously to avoid excessive API calls
